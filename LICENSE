OkHttp¶
HTTP is the way modern applications network. It’s how we exchange data & media. Doing HTTP efficiently makes your stuff load faster and saves bandwidth.

OkHttp is an HTTP client that’s efficient by default:

HTTP/2 support allows all requests to the same host to share a socket.
Connection pooling reduces request latency (if HTTP/2 isn’t available).
Transparent GZIP shrinks download sizes.
Response caching avoids the network completely for repeat requests.
OkHttp perseveres when the network is troublesome: it will silently recover from common connection problems. If your service has multiple IP addresses, OkHttp will attempt alternate addresses if the first connect fails. This is necessary for IPv4+IPv6 and services hosted in redundant data centers. OkHttp supports modern TLS features (TLS 1.3, ALPN, certificate pinning). It can be configured to fall back for broad connectivity.

Using OkHttp is easy. Its request/response API is designed with fluent builders and immutability. It supports both synchronous blocking calls and async calls with callbacks.

Get a URL¶
This program downloads a URL and prints its contents as a string. Full source.


OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

String run(String url) throws IOException {
  Request request = new Request.Builder()
      .url(url)
      .build();

  try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
    return response.body().string();
  }
}
Post to a Server¶
This program posts data to a service. Full source.


public static final MediaType JSON
    = MediaType.get("application/json; charset=utf-8");

OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

String post(String url, String json) throws IOException {
  RequestBody body = RequestBody.create(json, JSON);
  Request request = new Request.Builder()
      .url(url)
      .post(body)
      .build();
  try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
    return response.body().string();
  }
}
Further examples are on the OkHttp Recipes page.

Requirements¶
OkHttp works on Android 5.0+ (API level 21+) and Java 8+.

OkHttp depends on Okio for high-performance I/O and the Kotlin standard library. Both are small libraries with strong backward-compatibility.

We highly recommend you keep OkHttp up-to-date. As with auto-updating web browsers, staying current with HTTPS clients is an important defense against potential security problems. We track the dynamic TLS ecosystem and adjust OkHttp to improve connectivity and security.

OkHttp uses your platform’s built-in TLS implementation. On Java platforms OkHttp also supports Conscrypt, which integrates BoringSSL with Java. OkHttp will use Conscrypt if it is the first security provider:


Security.insertProviderAt(Conscrypt.newProvider(), 1);
The OkHttp 3.12.x branch supports Android 2.3+ (API level 9+) and Java 7+. These platforms lack support for TLS 1.2 and should not be used. But because upgrading is difficult, we will backport critical fixes to the 3.12.x branch through December 31, 2021.

Releases¶
Our change log has release history.

The latest release is available on Maven Central.


implementation("com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.10.0")
Snapshot builds are available. R8 and ProGuard rules are available.

Also, we have a bill of materials (BOM) available to help you keep OkHttp artifacts up to date and be sure about version compatibility.


    dependencies {
       // define a BOM and its version
       implementation(platform("com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp-bom:4.10.0"))

       // define any required OkHttp artifacts without version
       implementation("com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp")
       implementation("com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor")
    }
MockWebServer¶
OkHttp includes a library for testing HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/2 clients.

The latest release is available on Maven Central.


testImplementation("com.squareup.okhttp3:mockwebserver:4.10.0")
GraalVM Native Image¶
Building your native images with Graal https://www.graalvm.org/ should work automatically. This is not currently in a final released version, so 5.0.0-alpha.2 should be used. Please report any bugs or workarounds you find.

See the okcurl module for an example build.


$ ./gradlew okcurl:nativeImage
$ ./okcurl/build/graal/okcurl https://httpbin.org/get

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
